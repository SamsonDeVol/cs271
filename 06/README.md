This program translates Hack assembly into binary code

Here are the steps to run:
1. use Makefile command "make" on terminal to compile all files
2. use ./main filename.asm (such as max.asm)
2.1. to access .asm in this directory setup you must navigate
though /filename/filename.asm
3. in the directory of your filename.asm you should see filename.asm.hack
4. in filename.asm.hack is binary code, which can be used in a CPU emulator
such as the one included in nand2tetris

Thanks for stopping by!
